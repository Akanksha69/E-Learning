## Low level test cases

* It is deemed the requirements are not well understood or poorly documented.
* Low level (detailed) test cases will be written to help develop the requirements.
* A large team of testers will be sourced for the activity. Typically on short term contracts and often the majority of the team are junior.
* Test teams spend significant effort on writing detailed test cases. Often this will help challenge the requirements and may improve the overall understanding of the requirements.
* The activity of creating and reviewing of the scripts may not allow time for other important test activities
* Software is delivered to the test team.
* But the detailed test cases still do not match the system under test. Thus a lot of effort is spent updating the detailed test cases either before or during execution.
* Test case execution takes significant effort due to execution.
* The updating and execution of the test cases takes up the available test cycle time and allows no time to check outside the test cases e.g. exploratory testing.
* The testers gain experience but only develop a narrow range of competencies.
* The product is delivered to the customer and most-likely many use cases have been missed.
* The customer is unhappy and wants changes to the product (re-work).
* Although as software has now been delivered the test team have been downsized.
* Knowledge gained to date is lost
* The Product Manager states some features need updating and the test cases need updating.
* The few remaining testers voice their concerns that updating the large volume of detailed test cases is too much for the reduced team.
* Ultimately the must find a solution to this problem of large testing debt with few resources.
* Often the team will create a regression pack of high level test cases that a smaller team can manage effectively.
